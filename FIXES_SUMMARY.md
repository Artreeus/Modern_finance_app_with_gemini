## How to Test:

### 1. Test Login/Register Visibility:
```
1. Go to /auth/signin or /auth/register
2. All text should now be clearly visible
3. Dark background with white form
4. Black text on all labels and inputs
```

### 2. Test Add Transaction Modal:
```
1. Login and go to dashboard
2. Click "Add Transaction"
3. Modal should have white background
4. All text should be clearly visible
5. All form fields should be readable
```

### 3. Test Real Data in Analytics:
```
1. Create a new user account
2. Add some transactions (income and expenses)
3. Go to /analytics
4. Should show YOUR actual transactions
5. Charts will update based on YOUR data
6. No fake data will appear
```

### 4. Test PDF Generation:
```
1. Add some transactions for current month
2. Go to dashboard
3. Click "Download PDF Report"
4. PDF should download without errors
5. If error occurs, check console for specific error message
```

## Database Structure for Real Data:

All data now comes from these real MongoDB collections:
- `users` - User accounts
- `transactions` - Income/expense transactions
- `monthlysummaries` - Aggregated monthly data
- `advices` - AI-generated advice

## No More Demo Data!

Everything is 100% dynamic and pulls from your actual MongoDB database. When you create a new user, they will have NO data until they add transactions.

## Color Scheme Summary:

- **Backgrounds**: Dark gray (gray-900) for auth pages, white for forms
- **Text**: Gray-900 for main text, Gray-800 for labels, Gray-600 for secondary
- **Inputs**: White background, dark text, gray borders
- **Buttons**: Gradient from primary-600 to green-600
- **Modal**: White background with dark overlay

Everything is now production-ready with real data and proper visibility! ðŸŽ‰
