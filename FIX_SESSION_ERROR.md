# Fix Session & Theme Issues

## Issues Fixed:

1. âœ… **Mongoose Duplicate Index Warning** - Removed duplicate unique constraint
2. âœ… **Theme Toggle Added** - Dark/Light mode toggle button in top-right corner
3. âœ… **Theme Context Fixed** - Proper hydration handling to prevent page refresh issues

## To Fix JWT Session Error:

The JWT session error occurs because your browser has old session cookies encrypted with a different secret. Here's how to fix it:

### Method 1: Clear Browser Cookies (Recommended)

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Open your browser DevTools** (F12)
3. **Go to Application tab â†’ Cookies**
4. **Delete these cookies:**
   - `next-auth.session-token` (or `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`)
   - `next-auth.csrf-token`
   - `next-auth.callback-url`
5. **Restart dev server:** `npm run dev`
6. **Refresh the page**

### Method 2: Use Incognito/Private Window

- Simply open the site in an incognito/private browsing window

### Method 3: Different Browser

- Try opening the site in a different browser

## Theme Toggle

The theme toggle button is now in the **top-right corner** of the homepage:
- ðŸŒž Sun icon = Light mode
- ðŸŒ™ Moon icon = Dark mode
- Click to toggle between themes
- Your preference is saved in localStorage

## What Changed:

### 1. User Model (`models/User.ts`)
- Removed `unique: true` from email field definition
- Moved uniqueness to the index: `UserSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true })`
- This prevents the duplicate index warning

### 2. Theme Context (`contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)
- Fixed hydration issue by returning children during mount phase
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to prevent React warnings

### 3. Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- Added floating theme toggle button
- Integrated with ThemeContext
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Proper dark mode support throughout

## Testing:

1. **Theme Toggle:** Click the sun/moon icon in top-right
2. **Persistence:** Refresh the page - theme should persist
3. **Dark Mode:** All sections should properly switch colors
4. **Animations:** All animations should work smoothly

## If Issues Persist:

1. Check `.env` file has `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` set (at least 32 characters)
2. Clear all browser data for localhost:3000
3. Try: `npm run build && npm start` (production mode)
4. Check terminal for any new errors

**Note:** The mongoose warning might still appear once on the first connection but won't repeat. The JWT session error should be gone after clearing cookies.
