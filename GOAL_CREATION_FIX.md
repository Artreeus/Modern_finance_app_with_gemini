# Goal Creation Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-10-16

### 🐛 **Issue**
Goal creation was failing with validation error:
```
Goal validation failed: category: `investment` is not a valid enum value for path `category`.
```

### ✅ **Fixes Applied**

#### 1. **Updated Goal Model Categories** (`models/Goal.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
enum: ['savings', 'house', 'car', 'vacation', 'emergency', 'education', 'retirement', 'other']
```

**After:**
```typescript
enum: ['savings', 'investment', 'debt', 'emergency', 'vacation', 'education', 'home', 'retirement', 'other']
```

**Changes:**
- Added `investment` (was missing, causing validation error)
- Added `debt` (for debt payment goals)
- Renamed `house` → `home` (to match modal)
- Removed `car` (replaced with more general categories)

---

#### 2. **Fixed API Route** (`app/api/goals/route.ts`)

**Issues Fixed:**
- API expected `targetDate` but modal sent `deadline`
- API didn't accept `currentAmount` from modal
- Milestones didn't include `amount` field

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Now accepts deadline field from modal
const { name, description, targetAmount, currentAmount, category, priority, deadline } = body;

// Maps deadline to targetDate in model
targetDate: deadline ? new Date(deadline) : undefined

// Milestones now include amount field
const milestones = [
    { percentage: 25, achieved: false, amount: Math.round(targetAmount * 0.25) },
    { percentage: 50, achieved: false, amount: Math.round(targetAmount * 0.50) },
    { percentage: 75, achieved: false, amount: Math.round(targetAmount * 0.75) },
    { percentage: 100, achieved: false, amount: Math.round(targetAmount) },
];
```

#### 3. **Updated Goals Page** (`app/dashboard/goals/page.tsx`)

**Fixed Interface:**
```typescript
// Before
deadline: string;

// After
targetDate?: string;
```

**Fixed Display Logic:**
```typescript
// Now handles optional targetDate
const getDaysRemaining = (targetDate?: string) => {
    if (!targetDate) return null;
    // ... rest of logic
};

// Conditionally renders deadline only if exists
{daysLeft !== null && (
    <div>
        {/* Deadline display */}
    </div>
)}
```

---

#### 4. **Added Milestone Amount Field** (`models/Goal.ts`)

**Interface Updated:**
```typescript
milestones: {
    percentage: number;
    amount: number;      // ← Added
    achieved: boolean;
    achievedAt?: Date;
}[];
```

**Schema Updated:**
```typescript
milestones: [{
    percentage: { type: Number, required: true },
    amount: { type: Number, required: true },  // ← Added
    achieved: { type: Boolean, default: false },
    achievedAt: { type: Date },
}]
```

### 📋 **Category Mappings**

Modal categories now properly map to model:

| Modal Option | Model Value | Icon |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Savings | `savings` | 💰 |
| Investment | `investment` | 📈 |
| Debt Payment | `debt` | 🎯 |
| Emergency Fund | `emergency` | 🆘 |
| Vacation | `vacation` | ✈️ |
| Education | `education` | 🎓 |
| Home Purchase | `home` | 🏠 |
| Retirement | `retirement` | 🏖️ |
| Other | `other` | 📌 |
